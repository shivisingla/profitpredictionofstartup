# Startup Profit Prediction App

Startup Profit Prediction App is a Machine Learning Based App which is based on 50 Startup companies' data. The Goal of the app is to predict the Annual Profit of any company (Startup) based on the criterias such as R&D Expenses, Administrative Expenses and Marketting Expernses and also its location. The ML model used here is a Multiple Linear Regression model. The web App is being built using Flask and deployed to Heroku. The dataset is also provided in this repo along with the model's code (model.py). Feel Free to download and tweet things. 
Cheers!!!  

## Novelty:
1. Engineering features were applied to remove outliers, drop unwanted data, handle categoricl features, missing values, , explore the correltion b/w numerical features, relating b/w labels and features. Mean squared error of the algorithm was reduced w/o increasing model's complexity.
2. Techniques like grid search and hyperparameter tuning were used to select best model to a build a model suitable for website.
